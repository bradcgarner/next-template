  /* NOTE: the urls listed are social handles we want people to FOLLOW, not any ghost accounts.
   * If you need to edit the url of an existing handle: do that here. No need to coordinate with Brad.
   * BUT, if you want to add or remove a social profile (e.g. add Tumblr or remove Facebook), PLEASE coordinate that with Brad. This is because there is another part of the code that links these with icons; Brad needs to manage that part.
   * If you want to change how social SHARING is handled, e.g. allow to share via MySpace, coordinate that with Brad for similar reasons.
